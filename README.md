First example is 2D and 3D math expressions plotted side-by-side.

%Here begins the 2D plot
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}
\addplot[color=red]{exp(x)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
%Here ends the 2D plot
\hskip 5pt
%Here begins the 3D plot
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}
\addplot3[
    surf,
]
{exp(-x^2-y^2)*x};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
%Here ends the 3D plot
